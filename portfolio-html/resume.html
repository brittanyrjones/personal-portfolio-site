          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p class="summary">
            I used to work in the field of social services, using problem solving skills, logic, and compassion to help underrepresented members in the community learn life skills. I always wished that we could have more technology at work, to make navigating services
            for staff and client's easier. I soon realized that this resources did not exist for Social workers due to lack of available funds. Eventually, I decided to become a full stack developer, with the hope to bring these skills back to the community.
            I am currently a student at Ada Developers Academy in Seattle Washington.
